Business Case Report: Predicting SpaceX Falcon 9 First Stage Landing Success
Introduction

This business case report explores the potential benefits of using a machine learning model to predict the success of SpaceX Falcon 9 first stage landings. This model could help a company competing with SpaceX to offer more competitive pricing and make better strategic decisions.

Problem Statement

SpaceX offers Falcon 9 rocket launches to its customers for $62 million, while other companies charge upwards of $165 million. This price difference is due to SpaceX's ability to reuse the first stage of the rocket. However, predicting the success of this stage's landing can significantly impact the final launch price.

Proposed Solution

A machine learning model can use data from previous Falcon 9 launches to predict the likelihood of a successful first stage landing. The model could be trained using various machine learning algorithms, such as logistic regression or deep neural networks.

Benefits

Using this model could offer several advantages to a company competing with SpaceX, including:

Reduced launch costs: By accurately predicting landing success, the company can determine the final launch price with greater certainty. This allows the company to make more competitive bids and capture a larger market share.
Improved decision-making: The ability to predict landing success can significantly impact strategic decision-making. For instance, the company could prioritize launches with a higher likelihood of success or adjust insurance costs based on the model's predictions.
Costs

Costs associated with developing and deploying this model include:

Data collection costs: The cost of gathering the data needed to train the model
Model development costs: The cost of hiring data scientists and machine learning engineers to develop and train the model
Deployment costs: The cost of deploying the model into a production environment
Risks

Some risks associated with using this model include:

Model bias: The possibility that the model may be biased towards certain outcomes
Model accuracy: The possibility that the model may not be accurate enough to be reliable
Data availability: The possibility that the data needed to train and maintain the model may not be available
Recommendations

Considering the benefits, costs, and risks associated with using this model, the following recommendations are made:

Collect more data: If the model's accuracy is not sufficient, it may be necessary to collect more data to train the model.
Explore alternative machine learning algorithms: If the model's accuracy is not sufficient, it may be necessary to explore alternative machine learning algorithms.
Develop a user-friendly interface for the model: To make the model easier for stakeholders to use, it may be necessary to develop a user-friendly interface.
Conclusion

A machine learning model that can predict SpaceX Falcon 9 first stage landing success has the potential to provide significant advantages to a company competing with SpaceX. However, before investing in this project, it is crucial to carefully consider the associated costs and risks.
